          It explores the shared responsibility model of cloud computing. In
          this model, AWS manages the infrastructure's security, such as
          physical hardware, networking, & global infrastructure, while
          customers are responsible for securing their applications, data, &
          access configurations. Understanding this division is crucial for
          designing secure & compliant cloud architectures.

          identities and regulate access securely and efficiently. By
          transitioning from a single root user to a comprehensive system of
          users and groups, organizations gain fine-grained control over their
          cloud resources. The use of policies to assign permissions ensures
          that users operate under the least privilege principle, minimizing
          security risks and controlling costs.
