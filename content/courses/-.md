## Agenda

## Target audience and requirements

## Format

This project is a **hands-on project**.

Instead of the typical project flow, you will work through the exercises before I'll teach you the theory and background. This way, you will learn the most important concepts of Nuxt.js by doing and not by listening or copying lines of code from the slides.

After each exercise, we will go through the solution and theory together, reinforcing what you have learned.
