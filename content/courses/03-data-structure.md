## Course Overview
The **Data Structures & Algorithms Mastery** course is a comprehensive journey designed to transform you from a **programming beginner to an algorithmic problem-solving expert**. You'll not only learn how to implement data structures and algorithms but also **understand when and why to use them**, enabling you to write efficient, scalable, and optimized code.

### This course combines:
-   **Detailed explanations** with real-world analogies for conceptual clarity.
-   **Comprehensive code examples** in JavaScript with step-by-step analysis.
-   **Complexity analysis** for every algorithm to understand performance trade-offs.
-   **Visual diagrams** and illustrations to make abstract concepts concrete.
-   **Problem-solving strategies** to tackle coding interviews and competitive programming.

By the end, you'll have the **algorithmic thinking, implementation skills, and optimization mindset** needed to excel in technical interviews and build high-performance applications.
