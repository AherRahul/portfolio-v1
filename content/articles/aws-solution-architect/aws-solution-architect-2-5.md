## AWS Fundamentals Exam Tips

Are you planning to take an AWS certification exam? Whether you're aiming for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**, **AWS Certified Developer – Associate**, or the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**, success requires preparation and strategy. AWS certification exams test your knowledge of AWS services, cloud architecture, and best practices. In this blog, we’ll share essential tips and techniques to help you excel in your AWS fundamentals exam.



## Why AWS Certifications Matter

AWS certifications validate your expertise in cloud computing and demonstrate your ability to design, deploy, and operate applications on AWS. They are recognized globally and can open doors to lucrative career opportunities.

For beginners, the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** is a great starting point, while the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate** is perfect for those diving deeper into cloud architecture. Regardless of your goal, these tips will set you up for success.



## Top Exam Tips for AWS Fundamentals

### 1. **Understand the Exam Blueprint**
   - Every AWS certification exam has an **Exam Guide** that outlines:
     - Domains covered (e.g., Compute, Storage, Networking).
     - Percentage weightage of each domain.
   - Download the guide from the AWS Certification website and use it as your roadmap.

   **Pro Tip:** Focus more on domains with higher weightage. For example, in the AWS Solutions Architect exam, topics like “Designing Resilient Architectures” are heavily weighted.



### 2. **Familiarize Yourself with AWS Services**
   - AWS offers **200+ services**, but not all are tested in the exam. Focus on core services such as:

     - **Databases**: RDS, DynamoDB.
     - **Networking**: VPC, CloudFront, Route 53.
   - Understand the purpose and use cases for each service.

   **Pro Tip:** Use the **AWS Free Tier** to gain hands-on experience with these services.

   - Use platforms like:
     - **AWS Training Portal**
     - **Whizlabs**
     - **Tutorials Dojo**
     - **Udemy**
   - Review your mistakes thoroughly and revisit weak areas.

   **Pro Tip:** Time yourself during practice exams to get used to the pressure of answering questions within the allocated time.

   - **Shared Responsibility Model**: Understand the division of responsibilities between AWS and customers.
   - **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: Know how to design resilient systems.
   - **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Familiarize yourself with roles, policies, and permissions.
   - **Well-Architected Framework**: Review its five pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization.

     - Hosting a static website using S3 and CloudFront.
     - Creating a VPC with public and private subnets.
     - Deploying a serverless application using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

   - **Strategy:**
     - Answer easy questions first to save time.
     - Flag difficult questions and revisit them later.
   - Allocate 1-2 minutes per question and keep an eye on the timer.

   **Pro Tip:** Eliminate obviously incorrect answers to improve your chances of selecting the right one.



### 8. **Focus on Real-World Scenarios**
   - AWS exams often include scenario-based questions. Understand how services integrate to solve business problems.
   - Example:  
     **Scenario:** A company wants to migrate a database with minimal downtime. Which service would you recommend?  
     **Answer:** AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).

   **Pro Tip:** Think like an architect or developer when answering questions.



### 9. **Review the Exam Readiness Checklist**
