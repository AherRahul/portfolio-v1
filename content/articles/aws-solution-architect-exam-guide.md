- **Implementing disaster recovery**: Understand AWS strategies for backup, data replication, and recovery, such as cross-region replication and backup plans.

### 2. **Domain 2: Define Performant Architectures (28%)**
This domain focuses on creating systems that can handle high performance under varying workloads. Key topics include:
- **Selecting the right compute and storage resources**: AWS EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and different storage types for performance optimization.
- **Optimizing application performance**: Using caching, CDNs (CloudFront), and optimizing network configurations.
- **Designing scalable applications**: Load balancing, Auto Scaling, and database scaling techniques.

### 3. **Domain 3: Specify Secure Applications and Architectures (24%)**
Security is a key part of AWS architecture. This domain covers topics like:
- **Identity and access management (IAM)**: Understanding IAM roles, policies, and user management to control access to AWS resources.
- **Encryption and data protection**: Using services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS), CloudHSM, and encryption options for data in transit and at rest.
- **Designing secure network architectures**: VPCs, subnets, security groups, and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs).

### 4. **Domain 4: Design Cost and Operationally Efficient Architectures (18%)**
This domain focuses on optimizing for cost and operational efficiency:
- **Cost optimization strategies**: Choosing the right instance types, using AWS pricing models like Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, and AWS Cost Explorer to track costs.
- **Operational excellence**: Implementing monitoring and automation tools like AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and CloudFormation to ensure efficient management of resources.
