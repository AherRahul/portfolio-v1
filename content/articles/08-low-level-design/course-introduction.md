### Introduction: Understanding the Significance of Low-Level Design Interviews

Welcome to a course on **Low-Level Design Interviews**. I'm delighted to have you here.

When I first heard about LLD interviews back in 2024, there were almost no structured resources. The few that existed mostly stayed at the surface level, focused on “template solutions,” and skipped the part that actually matters in interviews.

Most resources today still lack quality and don't cover the full picture.

This course is my attempt to fill that gap and give you everything you need to confidently clear LLD interviews.

In late 2026, I started putting resources in my git repo [LLD Github repository](). A lot of people found it helpful and it quickly became one of the top resources for LLD interviews.

With this course, I’m taking it a step further: more structure, more depth, and significantly more interactivity.

My goal is to help you build a strong, practical understanding of object-oriented concepts and design patterns, and then apply them to real interview problems, all in one structured place.

I’ve kept a significant portion of this course free so it can help the wider community. 

Currently, the course is interactive and text-based. Over 2026, I plan to add videos for all the most important topics.

We’re improving the content every day. If you spot an issue or have feedback, let us know.

Lets go!
