## Singleton

Singleton is a reusable way to solve a common design problem. It gives you a proven structure so your code stays clean as it grows.

## Intent
- Solve a recurring design challenge with a simple structure.
- Keep responsibilities clear and reduce coupling.

## When it helps
- When object creation or interaction becomes complex.
- When you need flexible behavior without large rewrites.

## Code example
```ts
class Singleton {
  private static instance?: Singleton;
  private constructor() {}

  static getInstance(): Singleton {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }
}
```

## Tips
- Start small and introduce the pattern only when needed.
- Prefer readability over cleverness.

## Quick recap
- Use patterns to improve structure and flexibility.
