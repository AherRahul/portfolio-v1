Types of Language Models
---------------------

Language models (LMs) are sophisticated artificial intelligence systems meticulously trained on extensive textual datasets to comprehend and produce human language. By employing NLP techniques, these models can predict text sequences, and they play a crucial role in various applications, including chatbots and content generation.

Based on the size and complexity, you can distinguish two main types of language models:


### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models (LLMs), the advanced version of LMs, are trained on larger datasets and use advanced techniques such as deep learning and transformers to analyze complex relationships between words.

#### Examples:
*   GPT-4 by OpenAI
*   Gemini Flash v1.5 by Google
*   Claude v3 Opus by Anthropic

LLMs are computationally intensive. Hosting them locally poses significant challenges due to the high resource needs. This is where cloud service providers (CSPs) come in, offering scaled-up infrastructure capable of fulfilling the computationally heavy demands of LLM. You learn more about CSPs later in the course.

### 2. Small language models (SLMs)

Small language models (SLMs) are compact versions of LLMs that require less training data, have simpler architectures, and are quicker to develop. They are suitable for specific tasks and domains, offering focused expertise, and are applicable for devices with limited processing power.

#### Examples:
*   Gemma Models by Google
*   Phi-2 by Microsoft
*   7B by Mistral
*   Orca 2 by Microsoft

SLMs are intended to use fewer resources. They can be hosted locally on devices with minimal processing capability or on modest server infrastructures. They were designed to be more accessible and practical for specific tasks or domains with little computing complexity.

You’ve just explored the world of small and large language models. It’s time to meet a specific LLM group making big waves—generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. They became game changers and revolutionized the entire industry because they:

*   Use transformer architecture;
*   Are pre-trained on massive volumes of text data.

It allows them to understand complicated language patterns, generate new text creatively, translate languages, and write basic code.

OpenAI developed the first significant GPT model capable of advanced language processing and built a popular tool based on it—ChatGPT.

> ### Awareness of Pre-trained Transformers' Specifics
> *   Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are trained on specific datasets and do not learn or evolve during user interactions.
> *   Their responses are based solely on their initial training data.
> *   They operate under a "knowledge cutoff," meaning they may not be aware of events or trends after their training period and may exhibit biases based on their training data.
> *   Please use these models responsibly, acknowledging these specifics.

When discussing various types of language models, it's essential to delve into one of the foundational elements in natural language processing: tokens. Understanding the tokenization process sets the stage for more complex topics, including how transformers function.
