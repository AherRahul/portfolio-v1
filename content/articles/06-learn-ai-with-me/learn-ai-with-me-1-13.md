Benchmarks
---------------------

> **An LLM benchmark** is a standardized performance test used to evaluate various capabilities of AI language models.

  
Providing a benchmark makes it easier to compare one model against another and, ultimately, select the best one for your proposed use case.

A benchmark usually consists of a dataset, a collection of questions or tasks, and a scoring mechanism. After the benchmark’s evaluation, models are usually awarded a score from 0 to 100.

There are multiple benchmarks existing. Depending on the user case you will solve with language model help, you must choose an appropriate benchmark or a set of benchmarks. Here, you will explore only some of the main used to assess different aspects of language models:

### Perplexity 

> This classic metric measures how well a model predicts the next word in a sequence.
> 
> Lower perplexity scores indicate better performance, as the model effectively chooses the most likely word from a large vocabulary.
> 
> However, perplexity can be misleading as it doesn't directly assess real-world tasks or consider factors like fluency or coherence.

### General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and SuperGLUE 
> The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark tests an LLM’s natural language understanding capabilities and was notable upon its release for its variety of assessments.
> 
> SuperGLUE improves upon GLUE with a more diverse and challenging collection of tasks that assess a model’s performance across subtasks and metrics, with their average providing an overall score.
> 
> Analyzing performance across these diverse tasks gives you a broader understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.

### Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) 
> This benchmark goes beyond traditional NLP tasks, assessing the model's understanding across various subjects and domains.
>
> It includes questions from humanities, sciences, and other fields, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

### Human Evaluation
> Human judgment is crucial in assessing fluency, coherence, and task-specific success.
>
> Human evaluators can judge the model's outputs for readability, factual accuracy, and completion of the desired task.

Evaluating language models effectively requires a multifaceted approach, as a single benchmark might not capture all their capabilities.

### Choosing the Right Benchmark

The best benchmark for your needs depends on the specific language model and its intended use case. Consider these factors:

**Your goals:** What tasks do you need the model to perform?

**Model type:** Are you evaluating a general-purpose LLM or a specialized model?

**Desired aspects to assess:** Do you prioritize fluency, factual accuracy, or performance on a specific task?
