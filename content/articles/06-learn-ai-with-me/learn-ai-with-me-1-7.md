Limitations of LLMs
---------------------

As with any emerging technology that becomes integral to our daily lives, AI models—specifically LLMs—come with their unique inherent features. These features set the stage for both their capabilities and limitations:

### Transformer Architecture 

The operation of transformers relies on generating output based on the probability distribution of the next token in a sequence. This process naturally leads to non-deterministic responses, allowing for varied outputs under identical initial conditions.

### Training Data
LLMs produce text based on examples and patterns observed in their training data. They mirror all the characteristics of this data, including biases, inaccuracies, and topic specification. The training dataset is relevant up to the cut-off date of the training process. After this date, the model's database does not receive updates or incorporate new information unless retrained or supplemented with external, up-to-date data sources.

### Decision Logic Transparency
LLMs perform extensive computations using a complex array of internal settings and parameters. This complexity often makes the input-output relationships within these models difficult to decipher, causing most commercial LLMs to operate as "black boxes."

Companies developing LLMs typically do not disclose the technical details of these algorithms not only to protect proprietary technology but also to minimize security vulnerabilities.


These foundational features of LLMs introduce several usage limitations, which can be categorized into three main groups:

> ### **Cognitive Constraints and Interaction Challenges**
> LLMs perceive and process information differently from humans, leading to potential output limitations. They might make mistakes, produce fake facts ("hallucinate"), or generate biased responses.

> ### **Security Risks**
> The complex nature of LLMs does not make them immune to risks. They may be susceptible to various forms of cyber threats, including being tricked, attacked, or misused.

> ### **Privacy and Legal Concerns**
> LLMs may store and utilize input data. As such, issues surrounding data protection, responsibilities, rights, and compliance with legal regulations arise when using LLMs.

Understanding these limitations is crucial not only to maximize the effectiveness of AI for your tasks but also to anticipate possible challenges and implement robust usage practices and precautions.
