Tokens
---------------------

Have you ever wondered how LLMs understand your prompts? LLMs break down the prompts into tiny building blocks called tokens.

> **Token** is a single, distinct unit of meaning in natural language, which can be whole words, parts of words, or even punctuation. It is the smallest segment of a text that still makes sense. In Generative AI, tokens are bits of data that an AI model interprets, processes, and generates.

  

### Tokenization

The process of breaking down text data into tokens following certain predetermined rules is called **tokenization**. Since it directly relates to decoding human language, it heavily relies on NLP algorithms. The primary goal of tokenization is to make text data compatible for the AI model to comprehend, learn from, and consequently, use to generate human-like speech.

The tokenization process typically involves several steps, such as identifying word boundaries, handling punctuation, dealing with special characters, and addressing case sensitivity. Different tokenization techniques may be employed depending on the specific requirements of the task or the characteristics of the data. These techniques involve breaking down the text into various units, including:

*   Individual words (word tokens)
*   Parts of words (subword tokens)
*   Machine-readable bytes (byte-level tokens)
*   Individual characters, including letters, digits, punctuation marks, and special characters (character tokens)
*   Sentences or paragraphs (sentence or paragraph tokens)
*   Other types

Each of these techniques has its own strengths and limitations. For example, character tokens are useful when working with languages that do not have clear word boundaries or when handling out-of-vocabulary words. On the other hand, these small tokens can lead to longer text strings and increased computational load and expenses for large datasets.

The sentence or paragraph tokens are often used in tasks like text summarization or document classification, where understanding the broader context is crucial. However, large tokens like full sentences might miss subtle variations in the training or input data that can result in incorrect responses or hallucinations.

The most universal and widely used tokenization technique is word tokenization, where each token corresponds to a single word. However, challenges persist with this approach too, such as handling homonyms, idioms, misspellings, nonstandard text, out-of-vocabulary words, and other context-dependent parts.

> The AI model developers are responsible for overcoming these obstacles during the system's development and training phases. At the same time, tokenization is a mechanism working in the background within LLM, so as a user, you indirectly interact with it. And even though you don't control the tokenization mechanism, it's important to understand it to efficiently use your AI-powered tools.

For example, the phrase "Generative AI is a helping hand!" is divided into eight distinct tokens highlighted in different colors (including spaces).

Thus, tokens provide a powerful way for LLMs to process language. At the same time, there are several token features that are worth considering when working with LLMs.


*   **Maximum Input Length:** LLMs can only process a certain number of tokens in a single request. This limit is crucial and includes both the prompt and the response. It varies depending on the specific LLM, so checking the documentation beforehand is essential. Exceeding this limit can lead to incomplete or nonsensical responses.
*   **Optimizing Ð¡osts:** Most LLMs charge based on the number of tokens used. Keeping your prompts concise helps with cost efficiency. This ensures clear communication while minimizing unnecessary processing for the LLM.
