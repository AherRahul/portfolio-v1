Prompts
---------------------

> **A prompt** is a set of instructions or a question that acts as the initial input for an LLM. It essentially **defines the task** you want the LLM to perform. It provides context, specifies the desired output format or style, and guides the LLM towards a specific outcome.

The effectiveness of a model's reaction is heavily dependent on prompt quality, with well-crafted prompts leading to better outcomes. This is where the importance of prompt engineering comes into play.

> **Prompt engineering** is a crucial skill in artificial intelligence, involving crafting prompts to guide an AI tool's responses. To gain this skill, one must learn about AI behavior, language nuances, and the specific requirements of the AI tool.


This skill is essential for effective communication with LLMs, as it helps prevent misinterpretations, misunderstandings, and loss of context. Proper prompt engineering can also mitigate risks such as threats to data privacy, increased bias, and ethical issues, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of the AI system.

Prompt engineering skills can greatly influence the quality of responses from LLM. Here is a comparison of a prompt written without this skill versus a more sophisticated prompt from someone with prompt engineering skills:
