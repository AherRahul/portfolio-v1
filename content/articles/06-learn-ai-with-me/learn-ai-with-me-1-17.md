Course Completion
---------------------

You did it! You've reached the end of the Generative AI Fundamentals course!

This course was designed to equip you with a fundamental understanding of main AI concepts and their specifics, preparing you to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. At this point in your journey, you should be able to:

*   Identify and explain key terms associated with AI, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, generative AI, and language models.
*   Explain the tokenization process.
*   Describe the transformers' architecture.
*   Explain the prompt processing based on the transformers' architecture.
*   Classify the limitations of LLM usage and give examples for each limitation type.
*   Identify the reasons behind these limitations.
*   Recognize security limitations.
*   List mitigation strategies for cognitive and security limitations.
*   Mitigate privacy and legal (regulatory) limitations.
*   Recognize and describe major industry players, including leading vendors and cloud service providers.
*   List and explain technical and behavioral parameters used to characterize language models (LLMs and SLMs).
*   List the most common LLM benchmarks.
*   List the main approaches for expanding LLM capabilities.
*   Classify the LLM plugins and give examples for each plugin type.
*   Describe the structure and workflow of an RAG system.
*   Recall cases in different industries where AI was successfully implemented.

As a result, you should now feel confident in your understanding of essential AI concepts and be prepared to apply this knowledge in your professional setting.
