LM Landscape. Leading Vendors and Cloud Service Providers
---------------------

Thanks to achievements in computing power, open-source toolkits, and effective training procedures, language models are no longer exclusively the realm of tech giants. Innovative small companies are now creating these powerful tools alongside established computer and technology players.

**Leading organizations that created innovative LMs:**

*   Anthropic (Claude)
*   Cohere (Command)
*   Google (Gemini, Gemma)
*   Meta (Llama)
*   OpenAI (GPT, DALL-E, DaVinci)

Transformer architecture significantly expanded GenAI's capabilities, leading to near-human quality chatbots and the ability to generate creative content in various formats.

GenAI applications were made feasible through the collaborative efforts of the above-mentioned LLM vendors, the larger AI research community, and Cloud Service Providers.

> **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** offer a range of computing services over the Internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more. These providers host and manage the underlying IT infrastructure, allowing businesses to focus on their core operations.


In addition to hosting and serving GenAI applications, CSPs provide their clients with access to different foundation models that are ready for use out of the box.

Such a collaborative ecosystem is critical for facilitating AI developments, with CSPs serving as key facilitators of the AI hosting process.

The usefulness of CSPs becomes especially clear when dealing with large language models, which require advanced computational resources for training, deploying, and hosting.

The three main LLM vendors for generic use cases are OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. This doesn't consider specific use cases, open-source models, or on-device deployments.

For these model families, there are two options to consume a particular model:

*   On cloud platforms with the help of cloud services
*   Direct API access

Direct API access provides new features and model versions that cloud platforms may not release. Some features can only be accessed through the model provider API.

Below is a comparison table highlighting LLMs access availability across the three major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs): [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-model-catalog#tabs-oc7a46_tab0), and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden?hl=ru).

Please follow the relevant links to explore the large and small models the CSPs listed above provide.
