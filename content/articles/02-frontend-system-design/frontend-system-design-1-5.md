It's kind of like a sibling to REST API or GraphQL, enabling communication with the server in a unique way. RPC stands for **Remote Procedure Call**, and the "g" in gRPC stands for **Google**, as it was created by Google.

Let's understand it now:

Suppose there are two machines‚Äîone is the client (any machine) and the other is the server (another machine). In the end, when we call an API, it executes a function on the server. With RPC, instead of making a traditional API request, the client can directly call a function on the server. Below is the architecture diagram, and we will discuss each terminology in detail.

In REST API, data is transferred in **JSON** format, but in gRPC, it happens using **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**, which is an **IDL (Interface Definition Language)**. To use gRPC, we need **HTTP/2**.

Just like REST API send **serialized data** over the network, gRPC also transmits **protocol-serialized data**. However, gRPC maintains a **single long-lived connection** and supports **bidirectional streaming**.

So, referring to the screenshot above, once an **HTTP/2 request** is made using gRPC, **bidirectional data flow** happens. Each time we call a **server function**, a **bidirectional data flow** occurs, and the connection ends after the response.

We already discussed that gRPC uses **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** instead of **JSON**. Now, let‚Äôs understand **Protocol Buffers** and how **encoding and decoding** take place.

**Protocol Buffer (ProtoBuf)** is developed by Google.

* ProtoBuf is an **IDL (Interface Definition Language)** and also provides **serialization and deserialization**.
* It supports **binary data transfer**, unlike REST API, where we use `.json()`, in gRPC, we use `.proto` (also called **proto3**).
* The **.proto file** defines the request and response structure. This file enables **code conversion**, making it compatible with multiple languages.
* The response can be **deserialized in any language**, which makes gRPC highly flexible.

Honestly, this concept is a bit confusing, but we‚Äôll explore it further to understand it better.

### **Benefits of gRPC**

* Requires **less CPU resources**.
* **Faster** on mobile devices due to efficient serialization.

gRPC is **mainly used for server-to-server communication**, but we will also see how to use it in a **browser**. Since a browser acts as a **client machine**, we need a **gRPC client** that interacts with a **gRPC server** to call functions.

### **Let's Code**

Here is the repo link: [gRPC-first-setup](https://github.com/ashumsd7/gRPC-first-setup)

You can either **clone the repo** or **follow the documentation** to set up the client and server. If you haven‚Äôt used gRPC before, it might feel a bit **complex** at first, but at least **try it once**, as I did. **Something is better than nothing** üôÇ


### **Comparison with REST API**

* In **REST API**, we use **HTTP/HTTPS**, but in **gRPC**, we use **HTTP/2** as the default transport protocol.
* REST API use **JSON**, whereas gRPC uses **Protocol Buffers**.
* **No standard language** is required for REST API, but gRPC enforces **ProtoBuf IDL** as a standard.
* REST API transfer data in **JSON/XML/Text**, while gRPC uses **binary serialization** for efficiency.
* **JSON is more flexible**, but **ProtoBuf ensures a strict contract** between the client and server.
* REST API often rely on **third-party code generation tools**, whereas gRPC provides **automatic code generation**.


### **Advantages and Disadvantages**

### **Advantages**

‚úÖ **10x faster** compared to REST API calls

‚úÖ **Better security** since it uses **HTTP/2**

‚úÖ **Bidirectional streaming** support

‚úÖ **Automatic code generation**

‚úÖ **Language-agnostic** (Define proto once and use it in any language)

‚úÖ **Service discovery support**

‚úÖ **More secure communication**

### **Disadvantages**

‚ùå **Not human-readable** (Uses binary data instead of JSON)

‚ùå **Limited browser support**

‚ùå **No edge caching** (Due to the use of POST requests)

‚ùå **Steeper learning curve** compared to REST API
