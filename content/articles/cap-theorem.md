In computer science, the CAP theorem, sometimes called CAP theorem model or Brewer’s theorem after its originator, Eric Brewer, states that any distributed system or data store can simultaneously provide only two of three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP). During times of normal operations, a data store covers all three. However, according to the CAP theorem, a distributed database system can provide either consistency or availability when it experiences a network failure. In other words, in case of a network failure, it’s a tradeoff between consistency or availability, and that choice must be made in advance.

Let’s take a look.

## What is the CAP theorem?
The CAP Theorem is comprised of three components (hence its name) as they relate to distributed data stores:

- **Consistency**: All reads receive the most recent write or an error.
- **Availability**: All reads contain data, but it might not be the most recent.
- **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network failures (ie; dropped partitions, slow network connections, or unavailable network connections between nodes.)

In normal operations, your data store provides all three functions. But the CAP theorem maintains that when a distributed database experiences a network failure, you can provide either consistency or availability.

It’s a tradeoff. All other times, all three can be provided. But, in the event of a network failure, a choice must be made.

In the theorem, partition tolerance is a must. The assumption is that the system operates on a distributed data store so the system, by nature, operates with network partitions. Network failures will happen, so to offer any kind of reliable service, partition tolerance is necessary—the P of CAP.

That leaves a decision between the other two, C and A. When a network failure happens, one can choose to guarantee consistency or availability:

- High consistency comes at the cost of lower availability.
- High availability comes at the cost of lower consistency.

Consistency in CAP means having the most up-to-date information.


## User queries: consistent or available?

The moment in question is the user query. We assume that a user makes a query to a database, and the networked database is to return a value.

Whichever value is returned from the database depends on our choice to provide consistency or availability. Here’s how this choice could play out:

- On a query, we can respond to the user with the **current value on the server**, offering a highly available service. If we do this, there is no guarantee that the value is the most recent value submitted to the database. It is possible a recent write could be stuck in transit somewhere.
If we want to guarantee high consistency, then we have to **wait for the new write** or return an error to the query. Thus, we sacrifice availability to ensure the data returned by the query is consistent.


## Choosing system needs

To some, the choice between consistency and availability is really a matter of philosophical discussion that’s rarely made in practice. The reliability of these distributed systems is pretty good. That said, problems do happen. AWS experienced a big outage just before Thanksgiving 2020.

Where the theory says you can have only two of three components, professionals say that’s not always the case. **Eric Brewer, computer scientist and initial positor of the CAP theorem**, cleared up some confusion around the theorem, generalizing it from a hard either/or statement to one depending on the system’s need. He said:

> “The modern CAP goal should be to maximize combinations of consistency and availability that make sense for the specific application. Such an approach incorporates plans for operation during a partition and for recovery afterward, thus helping designers think about CAP beyond its historically perceived limitations.”

Choosing consistency and availability comes when choosing which database type to go with, such as SQL vs NoSQL. NoSQL databases can be classified based on whether they support high availability or high consistency.


## NoSQL
NoSQL databases do not require a schema, and don’t enforce relations between tables. All its documents are JSON documents, which are complete entities one can readily read and understand. They are widely recognized for:

- Ease-of-use
- Scalable performance
- Strong resilience
- Wide availability

**Examples of NoSQL databases include**:
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase Real-time DB
- MongoDB
- MarkLogic
- Couchbase
- CloudDB
- Amazon DynamoDB


## Consistency in databases
Consistent databases should be used when the value of the information returned needs to be accurate.

Financial data is a good example. When a user logs in to their banking institution, they do not want to see an error that no data is returned, or that the value is higher or lower than it actually is. Banking apps should return the exact value of a user’s account information. In this case, banks would rely on consistent databases.

**Examples of a consistent database include**:
- Bank account balances
- Text messages

**Database options for consistency**:
- MongoDB
- Redis
- HBase


## Availability in databases
Availability databases should be used when the service is more important than the information.

An example of having a highly available database can be seen in e-commerce businesses. Online stores want to make their store and the functions of the shopping cart available 24/7 so shoppers can make purchases exactly when they need.

**Database options for availability**:
- Cassandra
- DynamoDB
- Cosmos DB

Some database options, like Cosmos and Cassandra, allow a user to turn a knob on which guarantee they prefer - consistency or availability.


## let's understand CAP Theorem by an example

### Chapter 1: “Remembrance Inc” Your new venture :
Last night when your spouse appreciated you on remembering her birthday and bringing her a gift, a strange Idea strikes you. People are so bad in remembering things. And you’re sooo good at it. So why not start a venture that will put your talent to use? The more you think about it, the more you like it. In fact you even come up with a news paper ad which explains your idea

```
Remembrance Inc! - Never forget, even without remembering!  
Ever felt bad that you forget so much? Don’t worry. Help is just a phone
away!  
When you need to remember something, just call 555—55-REMEM and tell us
what you need to remember. For eg., call us and let us know of your
boss’s phone number, and forget to remember it. when you need to know it
back.. call back the same number\[(555)—55-REMEM \] and we’ll tell you
what’s your boss’s phone number.  
Charges : only $0.1 per request
```
So, your typical phone conversation will look like this:

> Customer : Hey, Can you store my neighbor’s birthday? <br/>
You: Sure.. when is it? <br/>
Customer : 2nd of jan <br/>
You: (write it down against the customer’s page in your paper note book) Stored. Call us any time for knowing your neighbor’s birthday again! <br/>
Customer : Thank you! <br/>
You: No problem! We charged your credit card with $0.1 <br/>

### Chapter 2 : You scale up:
Your venture gets funded by YCombinator. Your Idea is so simple, needs nothing but a paper notebook and phone, yet so effective that it spreads like wild fire. You start getting hundreds of call every day.

And there starts the problem. You see that more and more of your customers have to wait in the queue to speak to you. Most of them even hang up tired of the waiting tone. Besides when you were sick the other day and could not come to work you lost a whole day of business. Not to mention all those dissatisfied customers who wanted information on that day.
You decide it’s time for you to scale up and bring in your wife to help you.

Your start with a simple plan:
1. You and your wife both get an extension phone
2. Customers still dial (555)–55-REMEM and need to remember only one number
3. A pbx will route the a customers call to whoever is free and equally
 
### Chapter 3 : You have your first “Bad Service” :
Two days after you implemented the new system, you get a call from you get a call from your trusted customer Jhon. This is how it goes:

> - Jhon: Hey <br/>
> - You: Glad you called “Remembrance Inc!”. What can I do for you? <br/>
> - Jhon: Can you tell me when is my flight to New Delhi? <br/>
> - You: Sure.. 1 sec sir <br/>
      (You look up your notebook) <br/>
      (wow! there is no entry for “flight date” in Jhon’s page)!!!!! <br/>
> - You: Sir, I think there is a mistake. You never told us about your flight to delhi <br/>
> - Jhon: What! I just called you guys yesterday!(cuts the call!) <br/>


How did that happen? Could Jhon be lying? You think about it for a second and the reason hits you! Could Jhon’s call yesterday reached your wife? You go to your wife’s desk and check her notebook. Sure enough it’s there. You tell this to your wife and she realizes the problem too.

What a terrible flaw in your distributed design! **Your distributed system is not consistent! There could always be a chance that a customer updates something which goes to either you or your wife and when the next call from the customer is routed to another person there will not be a consistent reply from Remembrance Inc!**
 

### Chapter 4: You fix the Consistency problem:
Well, your competitors may ignore a bad service, but not you. You think all night in the bed when your wife is sleeping and come up with a beautiful plan in the morning. You wake up your wife and tell her:

” Darling this is what we are going to do from now”

- Whenever any one of us get a call for an update(when the customer wants us to remember something) before completing the call we tell the other person
- This way both of us note down any updates
- When there is call for search(When the customer wants information he has already stored) we don’t need to talk with the other person. Since both of us have the latest updated information in both of our note books we can just refer to it..

There is only one problem though, you say, and that is an “update” request has to involve both of us and we cannot work in parallel during that time. For eg. when you get an update request and telling me to update too, i cannot take other calls. But that’s okay because most calls we get anyway are “search” (a customer updates once and asks many times) . Besides, we cannot give wrong information at any cost.

“Neat” your wife says, “but there is one more flaw in this system that you haven’t thought of. What if one of us doesn’t report to work on a particular day? On that day, then, we won’t be able to take “any” Update calls, because the other person cannot be updated! We will have **Availability problem , i.e, for eg., if an update request comes to me I will never be able to complete that call because even though I have written the update in my note book, I can never update you. So I can never complete the call!”**
 

### Chapter 5: You come up with the greatest solution Ever:
You being to realize a little bit on why distributed system might not be as easy as you thought at first. Is it that difficult to come up with a solution that could be both **“Consistent and Available”**? Could be difficult for others, but not for you!! Then next morning you come up with a solution that your competitors cannot think of in their dreams! You wake your wife up eagerly again..

” look” , you tell her.. “This is what we can do to be consistent and available” . The plan is mostly similar to what I told you yesterday:

- i) Whenever any one of us get a call for an update(when the customer wants us to remember something) before completing the call, if the other person is available we tell the other person. This way both of us note down any updates
- ii) But if the other person is not available(doesn’t report to work) we send the other person an email about the update.
- iii) The next day when the other person comes to work after taking a day off, He first goes through all the emails, updates his note book accordingly.. before taking his first call.

Genius! You wife says! I can’t find any flaws in this systems. Let’s put it to use.. Remembrance Inc! is now both **Consistent and available!**
 

### Chapter 6: Your wife gets angry :
Everything goes well for a while. Your system is consistent. Your system works well even when one of you doesn’t report to work. But what if Both of you report to work and one of you doesn’t update the other person? Remember all those days you’ve been waking your wife up early with your Greatest-idea-ever-bullshit? * What if your wife decides to take calls but is too angry with you and decides not to update you for a day? Your idea totally breaks! Your idea so far is good for consistency and availability but is not Partition Tolerant!*

You can decide to be partition tolerant by deciding not to take any calls until you patch up with your wife.. Then your system will not be “available” during that time…
 

### Chapter 7: Conclusion :
So Let’s look at CAP Theorem now. Its states that, when you are designing a distributed system you can get cannot achieve all three of Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance. You can pick only two of:

Consistency: You customers, once they have updated information with you, will always get the most updated information when they call subsequently. No matter how quickly they call back
Availability: Remembrance Inc will always be available for calls until any one of you(you or your wife) report to work.
Partition Tolerance: Remembrance Inc will work even if there is a communication loss between you and your wife!
 
### Bonus : Eventual Consistency with a run around clerk :
Here is another food for thought. You can have a run around clerk, who will update other’s notebook when one of your’s or your wife’s note books is updated. The greatest benefit of this is that, he can work in background and one of your or your wife’s “update” doesn’t have to block, waiting for the other one to update. This is how many NoSql systems work, one node updates itself locally and a background process synchronizes all other nodes accordingly… The only problem is that you will lose consistency of some time. For eg., a customer’s call reaches your wife first and before the clerk has a chance to update your notebook , the customer’ calls back and it reaches you. Then he won’t get a consistent reply.. But that said, this is not at all a bad idea if such cases are limited. For eg., assuming a customer won’t forget things so quickly that he calls back in 5 minutes.
