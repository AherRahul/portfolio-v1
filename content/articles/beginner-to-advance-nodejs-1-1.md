## What is Nodejs?

Nodejs is not a programming language or a framework, but a **runtime environment** that allows JavaScript to be executed outside the browser. Normally, JavaScript was considered a client-side language that only ran in browsers to make web pages interactive. But with Nodejs, the same JavaScript can also be used on the server.  

It runs on **Google’s V8 JavaScript engine** (the same engine used by the Chrome browser). V8 compiles JavaScript directly into machine code, which makes execution extremely fast compared to older interpreters.  

Nodejs is designed to be **cross-platform**, which means I can run the same application on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems without rewriting code. It is also **open-source** and maintained by the **OpenJS Foundation**, which ensures community-driven growth.  

The most important technical innovation in Nodejs is its **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**. Traditional web servers used to handle one request at a time per thread, which meant they could get stuck (blocked) while waiting for slow tasks like database queries or file reading. Nodejs solved this problem by using a single-threaded event loop with asynchronous operations. This allows Nodejs to handle thousands of requests simultaneously without consuming huge system resources.  

In simple words, Nodejs makes JavaScript suitable not only for creating websites but also for building **API, real-time chat applications, streaming platforms, desktop apps, and even IoT solutions**.  

***My takeaway: Nodejs is the reason why today we can say "JavaScript everywhere" — the same language for frontend and backend.***



## Key Features of Nodejs

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on all major operating systems without modification.  
- **Open Source**: Free to use and developed by a large community under the OpenJS Foundation.  
- **High Performance with V8**: Runs JavaScript code extremely fast by compiling it to machine code.  
- **JavaScript Outside the Browser**: Allows full-stack development using only one language.  
- **Asynchronous and Non-Blocking**: Handles multiple tasks at the same time without waiting for one to finish.  
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses an event loop to manage tasks efficiently, making it ideal for I/O-heavy applications like chat systems or streaming services.  


## The History of Nodejs

### The Problem Before Nodejs
Before Nodejs existed, building web servers that could handle many users at once was difficult. Traditional servers like Apache or IIS used a **thread-per-request model**. This meant that if 10,000 people connected at the same time, the server would try to open 10,000 threads. Managing so many threads required a lot of memory and CPU, and servers often became slow or even crashed under heavy load.  

At the same time, JavaScript was locked inside browsers. Developers had to use multiple languages:  
- JavaScript for frontend,  
- PHP, Java, or Python for backend,  
- SQL for databases.  

This made development more complex and required switching between multiple languages and technologies.

Ryan Dahl looked at this problem and thought: “What if I could use JavaScript on the server and make it efficient enough to handle thousands of users at once?” This question led to the creation of Nodejs.


### 2009 – The Birth of Nodejs
Nodejs was created in **2009 by Ryan Dahl**. He wanted to build a system that was lightweight, fast, and capable of handling many concurrent users without crashing. To achieve this, he chose Google’s **V8 JavaScript engine** for its speed and combined it with **libuv**, a C++ library that handles asynchronous I/O operations.  

This combination introduced the concept of **non-blocking I/O** in server environments, which was revolutionary at the time. Instead of waiting for a task (like a database call) to finish, Nodejs could continue handling other requests in the meantime.  

Developers quickly realized the power of this model. Suddenly, it was possible to build chat apps, real-time games, and API that could handle thousands of simultaneous users with much lower resource usage compared to traditional web servers.

### 2010 – npm (Node Package Manager)
In 2010, the **npm package manager** was introduced. This was another game-changer. Before npm, sharing and reusing code libraries in JavaScript was difficult. With npm, developers could publish their own packages and use packages created by others with just a simple command.  

Today, npm has become the **largest software registry in the world**, hosting millions of packages. This ecosystem is one of the biggest reasons why Nodejs grew so fast.  



### 2011 – Windows Support
Initially, Nodejs worked only on Linux and macOS. But in 2011, thanks to a partnership between **Joyent** (the company backing Nodejs) and **Microsoft**, Nodejs was ported to run on Windows. This made it accessible to an even larger developer base and accelerated its adoption in enterprise environments.  



### 2012 – npm Independence
As npm grew, it became clear that it needed its own leadership. The responsibility of maintaining npm was handed over to **Isaac Z. Schlueter**, the creator of npm. Under his leadership, npm evolved into a full-fledged ecosystem, independent of Nodejs itself but still tightly integrated.

### 2014 – The io.js Fork
In 2014, some members of the Nodejs community became frustrated with the slow pace of development and the governance structure under Joyent. To move faster, **Fedor Indutny** created a fork of Nodejs called **io.js**.  

io.js quickly gained popularity because it had faster release cycles and was more open to contributions from the community. However, this also created confusion since developers had to choose between Nodejs and io.js.  



### 2015 – Nodejs Foundation
To solve the division, the **Nodejs Foundation** was formed in 2015. This provided neutral and transparent governance. One of the first major steps of the foundation was to merge **io.js** back into Nodejs. This reunification helped the ecosystem stabilize and ensured that all improvements from io.js became part of Nodejs.  



### 2019 – OpenJS Foundation
In 2019, the **Nodejs Foundation** merged with the **JS Foundation** (which managed many other JavaScript projects). Together they formed the **OpenJS Foundation**.  

This foundation now provides long-term support, funding, and governance for Nodejs and several other important JavaScript projects. It ensures that Nodejs continues to evolve in a sustainable and community-driven way.

## Why Nodejs Matters Today
Nodejs completely changed the way backend development works. It unified frontend and backend with one language, JavaScript, making life much easier for developers. Its event-driven model makes it perfect for building modern applications like chat apps, streaming services, online games, and scalable API.  

Another major reason for its success is the npm ecosystem, which provides ready-made solutions for almost any problem. Instead of reinventing the wheel, developers can just install a package and focus on building features.  

With backing from the OpenJS Foundation and contributions from thousands of developers worldwide, Nodejs continues to be one of the most popular and powerful tools in modern software development.  



## My Key Learnings
- Ryan Dahl's main goal was to fix the **blocking I/O problem** and allow **JavaScript on the server**.  
- The launch of **npm in 2010** gave Nodejs an ecosystem that made it explode in popularity.  
- The **io.js fork in 2014** highlighted the importance of open governance in open-source projects.  
- The formation of the **Nodejs Foundation in 2015** reunited the community.  
- The **OpenJS Foundation in 2019** ensured Nodejs has a sustainable future.  

If asked in an interview: *"Why was Nodejs created?"*  
The answer is: *Nodejs was created to allow JavaScript to run on the server and to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently using non-blocking I/O.*
