description: "Systems Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase. The goal is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance."

## What is Node JS?

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime enviroment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Its a JS runtime built on top of chrome v8 JS Engine. Node JS is Cross Platform ( Can run on different type of systems) , Open Source: Code is Open and Managed by Open JS Foundation ( Organization)
 and it **executes JavaScript outside the web browsers**. Node JS has an **event driven architecture ( will discuss later)** and capable of **Asynchronous / non blocking I/O**

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on **Chrome's V8** JavaScript engine.
- It is maintained by the **OpenJS** Foundation.
- Node.js allows JavaScript to be executed **outside of a web browser**.
  This means that while JavaScript is traditionally associated with the web and
  browsers, Node.js extends its reach, allowing you to run JavaScript code on
  servers, desktops, and even embedded systems. This is why Node.js is often
  described with the phrase "Run JavaScript Everywhere."
- Node.js features an **event-driven architecture** and supports **asynchronous I/O (non-blocking I/O)**. [Covered in depth in Episode 06]

initially Node JS was developed it was just for Mac OS and Linux
in 2011 windows support came and ( Joyent + Microsoft ) they given
node js support for windows

### 2014:  Fedor Indutny forked and made IO.js
Because When development was slow nowadays because Joyent  has left
so people was started contributing it
 [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny) was one of those

Node.js Foundation came and resolved all conflicts between io.js and others
a legal foundation started managing this
