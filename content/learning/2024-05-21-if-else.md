The Java if statement is used to test the condition. It checks boolean condition: true or false. There are various types of if statement in Java.

**Some abbreviations that will be used in this learning:**
- System.out.print - SOP
- System.out.println - SOPln 


## Agenda

- Java Conditions and If Statements
- The if Statement
- The else Statement
- The else if Statement
- Quizzes
- Categorize triangle
- Max of three
- Fizz Buzz
- Nested If Else
- Categorize into positive, negative and zero

> ## 1. Java Conditions and If Statements

You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b
- Equal to a == b
- Not Equal to: a != b
- You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed



> ## 2. The if Statement

Use the **_if_** statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is **_true_**.

**Syntax**
```
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

> **Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.**


### Example's

> ### **Q1.** Sravan loves drinking tea. But he is out of sugar. Sravan is asking his neighbour Karthik?

```
if (do_you_have_suger) {
    then => Borrow some suger
} else {
    then => don't do anything
}
```

> ### **Q2.** Eligibility criteria for voting.

**Correct logic to check whether you are eligible to vote.**

- [ ] age > 180
- [ ] age != 17
- [ ] age == 18
- [x] age >= 18

## Code question

Check if someone has normal temperature: Normal temp = [98.0 to 98.9]
* 98.1 -> Normal temperature
* 99 -> Not normal temperature
* 97.9 -> Not normal temperature

Explain -> ______98.0________98.9_______
* 96.8 -> Not normal temperature
* 98.5 -> Normal temperature


```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
double temp = sc.nextDouble();
if (temp >= 98.0 && temp >= 98.9) {
    System.out.println("Normal temperature");
}
```
---

> ## **2.** The else Statement

Now, we want to do something or the other accordingly when the condition is true or false. Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

### Syntax of if....else
```
if (condition) {
    // Statements to run, when above condition True
} else {
    // Statements to run, when above condition False
}
```

### Flow 1
```
if (condition) {
    Statement 1
} else {
    Statement 2
}
```
> If Condition is True: Statement 1 will execute <br />
> If Condition is False: Statement 2  will execute<br />

### Flow 2
```
Statement 1
if (condition) {
    Statement 2
} else {
    Statement 3
}
Statement 4
```

> If Condition is True: Statement 1, 2, 4 will execute <br />
> If Condition is False: Statement 1, 3, 4 will execute<br />

    System.out.println("Retired");
} else {
    System.out.println("Few more years of service.");
}
```

> ### **Q1.** Predict the output:

> ## Modulus Operator

Modulus operator (%) -> Gives remainder

```
System.out.println(17 % 4) -> Remainder = 1
System.out.println(24 % 2) -> Remainder = 0
System.out.println(97 % 2) -> Remainder = 1
System.out.println(82 % 2) -> Remainder = 0
```

Explain even and odd numbers. <br />
**Even numbers:** Numbers which are divisible by 2.<br />
Eg: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12..<br />
When we divide the number with 2, remainder = 0<br />
**Odd numbers:** Numbers which are not divisible 2.<br />
Eg: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11..<br />
When we divide the number with 2, remainder = 1<br />


---

> ### Example 1: Read a number and check if number is odd or even.
```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
if (a % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is even");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is odd");
}
```

---

> ### Example 2: Check if a number is divisible by 5.

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
if (a % 5 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is divisible by 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is not divisible by 5");
}
```

---

> ### Example 3: Check if a number is divisible by 2 or 3.

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
if (a % 2 == 0 || a % 3 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is divisible by 2 or 3");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is not divisible by 2 and 3 both");
}
```

## Code Question's (Assignment)

> ### Question: Read 2 numbers and print max of 2 numbers.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
a = 5 , b = 10
Max of a and b = 10
```


```plaintext
a = 15 , b = 10
Max of a and b = 15
```


```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
int b = sc.nextInt();
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println(a);
} else {
    System.out.println(b);
}

```





> ### Question: Predict the output: For input: 45 45

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
int b = sc.nextInt();
if (a > b) {
    System.out.print(a);
} else {
    System.out.print(b);
}
```

# Choices
- [ ] Error
- [ ] 45<br>45
- [x] 45




> ## 10 Question: Categorize Number <br/> Given an integer n0, categorize it into positive, negative or zero.

Category: 
```plaintext
n = 10: n > 0: print "positive number"
n = -27: n < 0: print "negative number"
n = 0: n == 0: print "zero"
```

```
public static void main() {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scn.nextInt();
    if (a > 0) {
        System.out.println("positive number");
    }
    if (a < 0) {
        System.out.println("negative number");
    }
    if (a == 0) {
        System.out.println("zero");
    }
}
```


**Syntax:**

```
if (cond_1) {
    // Statements if cond_1 is true
} else if (cond_2) {
    // Statements if cond_1 is false and cond_2 is true
} else {
    // Statements if cond_1 is false and cond_2 is false
}
```

> ### **Note:** "else" is optional.


> ## 3. The else if Statement

Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

### Flow
```
Statement 1
if (cond_1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
    Statement 2
} else if (cond_2) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    Statement 3
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
    Statement 4
}
Statement 5
```


Explain the above flow according to below table.

| Conditions which are true | Statements executed |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|             1             |        1 2 5        |
|             2             |        1 3 5        |
|         All false         |        1 4 5        |
|            1 2            |        1 2 4        |


> **Note:** If a condition is true, it will execute and will come out of If/Else block and execute remaining statements. <br />
> **Note:** We can have multiple "else if ()" blocks.

Back to Categorize number problem,


```
public static void main() {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scn.nextInt();
    if (a > 0) {
        System.out.println("positive number");
    } else if (a < 0) {
        System.out.println("negative number");
    } else {
        System.out.println("zero");
    }
}
```

> ### Example: Is the below code correct or not?
```
int a = 10;
else if (a > 5) {
    System.out.println("Number is more than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is not more than 5");
}
```

> Correct Answer: Compilation error.

We cannot write any `else if ()` without `if ()` block.

> ## 5. Categorize Triangles

### Categorize Triangles : Categorize triangle on the basis of the length of the sides

```plaintext
Equilateral: When the length of the all the sides are equal.
Isosceles: When the length of any two sides are equal.
Scalene: When the length of all sides are different.
```

Let `a`, `b`, `c` be the length of the three sides of a triangle. Given in each case they take some values, tell the category of the triangle. It is the given that the input values for a, b, c are positive integer values.

```plaintext
a = 20, b = 20, c = 20 
-- Output = Equilaterial
```

```plaintext
a = 7, b = 12, c = 9 
-- Output = Scalene
```

```plaintext
a = 5, b = 13, c = 5 
-- Output = Isosceles
```

```plaintext
a = 12, b = 7, c = 7 
-- Output = Isosceles
```

The equivalent code for implementing the above logic is as follows:

```java
if (a == b && b == c) {
   SOPln("Equilateral"); 
} else if (a == b || b == c || a == c) {
    SOPln("Isosceles");
} else {
    SOPln("Scalene");
}
```

> ## 6. Max of three: Given three numbers, print the maximum among them. 

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/045/724/original/upload_a249488f4da0204e8671e22d85267672.png?1693733958" alt= “” width ="700" height="600">


Note that `a`, `b`, `c` can take any integer values.
Stress on the point that `a`, `b`, `c` can also take equal values. The three test case demonstrates this point.

```plaintext
* a = 7,  b = 20, c = 50 ==> max = 50
* a = 10, b = 9,  c = 10 ==> max = 10
* a = 3,  b = 3,  c = 3  ==> max = 3
```

The equivalent code for implementing the above logic is as follows:

```java
if (a >= b && a >= c) {
   SOPln("a"); 
} else if (b >= c) {
    SOPln("b");
} else {
    SOPln("c");
}
```


---
> ## 7. Fizz-Buzz
```plaintext
Given a number, 
* print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
* print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
* print "Fizz-Buzz" if the number is divisble by both 3 and 5.
```

For example,
* n = 39, O/p = Fizz
* n = 25, O/p = Buzz
* n = 15, O/p = Fizz-Buzz
* n = 13, O/p = `No output`

**How to implement this?**

The following code shows a **wrong implementation** of the above logic:

```java
if (n % 3 == 0) {
    SOPln("Fizz");
} else if (n % 5 == 0) {
    SOPln("Buzz");
} else {
    SOPln("Fizz-Buzz");
}
```

The above code prints "Fizz-Buzz" for n = 11, but this is wrong as n is neither divisble by 3 nor 5. So there should have no output for this number.

**Another wrong implementation is as follows:**

```java
if (n % 3 == 0) {
    SOPln("Fizz");
} else if (n % 5 == 0) {
    SOPln("Buzz");
} else if (n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0) {
    SOPln("Fizz-Buzz");
}
```

The above code prints "Fizz" for n = 15, but this is wrong as n is divisble by 3 and 5 both. So the correct output should be "Fizz-Buzz".

So finally, the **correct implementation** of this logic is as follows:

```java
if (n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0) {
    SOPln("Fizz-Buzz");
} else if (n % 3 == 0) {
    SOPln("Fizz");
} else if (n % 5 == 0) {
    SOPln("Buzz");
}
```

- [ ] Hey there
- [ ] Hello
- [x] No output
- [ ] Error


**Explanation:**
We are not getting an error because the inner if statement with the false condition is not executed due to the if condition being false. Therefore, the else block following it is also not executed. The program simply moves on to the next line, which is outside of any control structures and executes the statement `System.out.println("Hello");` as expected.

The else block following the outer if statement is also not executed since the condition of the outer if statement is true, and the program again moves to the next line and executes the statement `System.out.println("Hello");`

> ## Categorise the number Given a number, classify it as follows:
```plaintext
* +ve and even
* +ve and odd
* -ve and even
* -ve and odd
```

```java 
public static void main() {
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    if (num > 0) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            SOPln("Positive and even");
        }
        else {
            SOPln("Positive and odd");
        }
    }
    else {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            SOPln("Negative and even");
        }
        else {
            SOPln("Negative and odd");
        }   
    }

## Scope of a Variable

It defines the point till where you can use the variable. You can only use a variable till the closing bracket of the block in which it was created.

**Example 1:**

```java=
public static void main() {
        
        
    int x;
    x = 5;

    int y;
    y = 20

}
```

Scope of variable `x`: Line 4 to 10
Scope of variable `y`: Line 7 to 10

**Example 2:**

```java=
public static void main() {
          
    int x = 10;
    if (x == 10) {
        int y = 5;
        SOP(y);
    }
    int z = 9;

}
```

Scope of variable `x`: Line 3 to 10
Scope of variable `y`: Line 5 to 7
Scope of variable `z`: Line 8 to 10

**Example 3:**

```java=
public static void main() {
    int a = 10;
    {
        a = 20;
    }
    SOP(a); 

}
```

Scope of variable `a`: Line 2 to 8
Also the code will print 20 as the changes done in the variable values are not restricted to that block in which the change is done. But the life of the variable is restricted to the block in which it was created.

**Example 4:**

```java=
public static void main() {
    int x = 10;
    {
        int y = 20;
        SOP(x + " " + y);
    }
    {
        SOP(x + " " + y); // This line will give error as y is not present in its scope
    } 

}
```

**Example 5:** Redefining variable error

```java=
public static void main() {
    int a = 90;
    {
        int a = 7; // This line will give error as variable a is already defined in this scope
        SOPln(a);
    }

}
```
