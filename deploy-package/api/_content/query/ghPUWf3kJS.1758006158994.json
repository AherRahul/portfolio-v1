Now, we could just keep adding whatever we want to app.js, and technically, it would work. But that's not the best way to do things because the file would get cluttered and hard to manage. Instead, we need multiple files.So, you'll use require to include different modules into your main file.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles","dateModified":"2025-04-08","datePublished":"2025-04-08","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"01-beginner-to-advance-nodejs","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"readingTime":{"text":"5 min read","minutes":4.53,"time":271800,"words":906},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-4.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-4.md","_stem":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-4","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-4"}},{"_path":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-6","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"libuv & async IO in Node.js","description":"If you read Node.js's definition, it mentions an event-driven architecture and its ability to handle asynchronous I/O. These two concepts are crucial to understand, so take your time to read and grasp them thoroughly. We know JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language, meaning the code runs in one direction like a one-way road, with one task executing at a time.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles","dateModified":"2025-04-10","datePublished":"2025-04-10","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"01-beginner-to-advance-nodejs","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"readingTime":{"text":"6 min read","minutes":5.11,"time":306600,"words":1022},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-6.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-6.md","_stem":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-6","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-6"}}]
