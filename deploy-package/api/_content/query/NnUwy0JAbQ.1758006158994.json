Node.js is a fast, scalable runtime that enables asynchronous, event-driven programming, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps and streaming services. You'll also learn to build server-side applications from scratch, manage dependencies with npm, and use frameworks like Express.js.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles","dateModified":"2025-04-06","datePublished":"2025-04-06","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"01-beginner-to-advance-nodejs","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"readingTime":{"text":"5 min read","minutes":4.165,"time":249900,"words":833},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-2.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-2.md","_stem":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-2","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-2"}},{"_path":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-4","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Module.exports & require","description":"As you saw in the last episode, we wrote our first line of code in Node.js. Now, we could just keep adding whatever we want to app.js, and technically, it would work. But that's not the best way to do things because the file would get cluttered and hard to manage.
