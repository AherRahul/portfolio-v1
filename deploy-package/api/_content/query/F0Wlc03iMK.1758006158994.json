It begins with the basics of web browsers sending HTTP/HTTPS requests to servers and receiving responses. The role of DNS (Domain Name System) in translating domain names into IP addresses, which act as unique identifiers for devices on a network, is crucial.The topic delves into protocols like TCP/IP, which ensure reliable data transmission across networks, and explores concepts such as request-response cycles and status codes that define server interactions.

As applications and services become more popular, they must be able to handle increased traffic and data without compromising performance or reliability. In this article, we will explore what scalability is, why it is important, and how to achieve it in system design. The truth is, many of us don’t dive deep enough into scalability to truly grasp its significance in system design. Consequently, we fail to impress interviewers who are looking for candidates with a comprehensive understanding of this crucial aspect.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/system-design-scalability.md","dateModified":"2024-05-19","datePublished":"2024-05-19","showOnArticles":true,"topics":["system-design","aws","lld"],"readingTime":{"text":"11 min read","minutes":10.195,"time":611700,"words":2039},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:system-design-scalability.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/system-design-scalability.md","_stem":"articles/system-design-scalability","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/system-design-scalability","images":[{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c3de2b-0f07-436f-9d62-e06472018457_2136x1090.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aee39d5-44a8-4a47-a5a1-b566a1af441d_1086x466.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd53c5510-6fc1-4521-8415-94b9671391c0_1180x276.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2096d317-a4b7-4c00-9fb2-c8d2ead22d4f_832x998.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9903f53c-9fc6-4254-a298-c82945acd466_1406x898.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e92b3d-791e-4951-8b6b-eb1d9b2bcea2_5667x2834.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11a9323-c04a-47be-8921-649e6f3d3b96_1228x1082.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c6b8c2d-be17-47ab-b817-7b173b6e59c9_1160x482.png"},{"loc":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1822f3-9363-4d5c-95e4-ed5f8dae5018_1324x428.png"}]}}]
