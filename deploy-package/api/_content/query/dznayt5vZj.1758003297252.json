[{"_path":"/articles/rate-limiting","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Rate Limiting","description":"Rate limiting runs within an application, rather than running on the web server itself. Typically, rate limiting is based on tracking the IP addresses that requests are coming from, and tracking how much time elapses between each request. The IP address is the main way an application identifies who or what is making the request. A rate limiting solution measures the amount of time between each request from each IP address, and also measures the number of requests within a specified timeframe. If there are too many requests from a single IP within the given timeframe, the rate limiting solution will not fulfill the IP address's requests for a certain amount of time.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/rate-limiting.md","dateModified":"2024-05-24","datePublished":"2024-05-24","showOnArticles":true,"topics":["system-design","aws","lld"],"readingTime":{"text":"8 min read","minutes":7.625,"time":457500,"words":1525},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:rate-limiting.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/rate-limiting.md","_stem":"articles/rate-limiting","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/rate-limiting"}},{"_path":"/articles/throughput-and-latency","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Throughput and Latency?","description":"Latency and throughput are two metrics that measure the performance of a computer network. Latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network. Networks with a longer delay or lag have high latency, while those with fast response times have lower latency. In contrast, throughput refers to the average volume of data that can actually pass through the network over a specific time. It indicates the number of data packets that arrive at their destinations successfully and the data packet loss.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/throughput-and-latency.md","dateModified":"2024-05-20","datePublished":"2024-05-20","showOnArticles":true,"topics":["system-design","aws","lld"],"readingTime":{"text":"8 min read","minutes":7.01,"time":420600,"words":1402},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:throughput-and-latency.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/throughput-and-latency.md","_stem":"articles/throughput-and-latency","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/throughput-and-latency","images":[{"loc":"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/cb4e5208b4cd87268b208e49452ed6e89a68e0b8/2016/10/24/Datapath_Image1.jpg"},{"loc":"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2020/03/12/Screen-Shot-2020-03-12-at-3.10.05-PM.png"}]}}]
