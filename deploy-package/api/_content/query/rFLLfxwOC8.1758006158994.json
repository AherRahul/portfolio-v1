A standardised communications protocol is one that has been codified as a standard. Examples of these include WiFi, the Internet Protocol, and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles","dateModified":"2025-03-02","datePublished":"2025-03-02","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"02-frontend-system-design","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read","minutes":1.58,"time":94800,"words":316},"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"image.png","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/duojkrgue/image/upload/v1744045766/Portfolio/FrontendSystemDesignCourse/2_qlrcpc.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"http-hypertext-transfer-protocol"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Used in web browsers for transferring hypertext documents.
