Latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network. Networks with a longer delay or lag have high latency, while those with fast response times have lower latency. In contrast, throughput refers to the average volume of data that can actually pass through the network over a specific time. It indicates the number of data packets that arrive at their destinations successfully and the data packet loss.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/throughput-and-latency.md","dateModified":"2024-05-20","datePublished":"2024-05-20","showOnArticles":true,"topics":["system-design","aws","lld"],"readingTime":{"text":"8 min read","minutes":7.01,"time":420600,"words":1402},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:throughput-and-latency.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/throughput-and-latency.md","_stem":"articles/throughput-and-latency","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/throughput-and-latency","images":[{"loc":"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/cb4e5208b4cd87268b208e49452ed6e89a68e0b8/2016/10/24/Datapath_Image1.jpg"},{"loc":"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2020/03/12/Screen-Shot-2020-03-12-at-3.10.05-PM.png"}]}},{"_path":"/articles/what-is-system-design","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"What is System Design?","description":"Systems Design is a critical discipline in software engineering, focused on creating a detailed blueprint for a system’s architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data. It is a structured approach to designing complex systems that meet specific requirements and perform efficiently under varying conditions. The primary goal of systems design is to translate user needs, business goals, and technical constraints into a well-organized and effective system structure. Systems design bridges the gap between these requirements and the actual implementation, ensuring the system is both usable and efficient.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/what-is-system-design.md","dateModified":"2024-05-22","datePublished":"2024-05-22","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"beginner-system-design","topics":["system-design","aws","lld"],"readingTime":{"text":"6 min read","minutes":5.315,"time":318900,"words":1063},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:what-is-system-design.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/what-is-system-design.md","_stem":"articles/what-is-system-design","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/what-is-system-design"}}]
