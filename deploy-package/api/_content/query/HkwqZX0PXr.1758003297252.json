How does Node.js achieve this? In JavaScript, we follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), which is related to functions and scope. If you're unfamiliar, you can Google it. The idea is to only expose what is necessary to the global scope, keeping everything else private. To achieve PoLP, wrap your code in a function or immediately invoke it (IIFE).","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles","dateModified":"2025-04-09","datePublished":"2025-04-09","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"01-beginner-to-advance-nodejs","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"readingTime":{"text":"4 min read","minutes":3.995,"time":239700,"words":799},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-5.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-5.md","_stem":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-5","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-5"}},{"_path":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-7","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"sync, async, setTimeoutZero in Node.js","description":"In the last few sessions, we have seen how Node.js code runs. If something is synchronous, the V8 engine handles it, or in case of asynchronous tasks, libUV steps in. You can think of Node.js having two best friends, like Jai and Veeru. Whenever a problem (or code) comes in, they handle it accordingly.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles","dateModified":"2025-04-11","datePublished":"2025-04-11","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"01-beginner-to-advance-nodejs","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"readingTime":{"text":"5 min read","minutes":4.455,"time":267300,"words":891},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-7.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-7.md","_stem":"articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-7","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-7"}}]
