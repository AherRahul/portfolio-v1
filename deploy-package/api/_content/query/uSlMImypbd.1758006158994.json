The term “ACID” stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the four key properties of an ACID transaction. Essentially, ACID transactions guarantee that database operations are executed correctly, and if there is any kind of failure, the database can recover to a previous state without losing any data or impacting the consistency of the data. In other words, ACID transactions provide a high level of assurance that database transactions will be processed reliably and that data will be stored accurately and consistently.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/acid-transactions.md","dateModified":"2024-05-22","datePublished":"2024-05-22","showOnArticles":true,"topics":["system-design","aws","lld"],"readingTime":{"text":"10 min read","minutes":9.7,"time":582000,"words":1940},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:acid-transactions.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/acid-transactions.md","_stem":"articles/acid-transactions","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/acid-transactions"}},{"_path":"/articles/aws-solution-architect-1-1","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Exam Guide","description":"Consistency and standards are important for building a unified design language and help the user know what to expect from our product and how to use it.
