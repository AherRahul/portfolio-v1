In this blog, we’ll explore what GraphQL is, its benefits, and why it’s so popular. Suppose your app needs information about continents, countries, and languages. If you’re using REST APIs, you’ll likely call multiple APIs to fetch this data and then organize it for your frontend. Be patient—it’s not an Instagram Reel, but for serious learners, it’ll be worth the read.\n","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"duration":"11:00 mins read","photo_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/duojkrgue/image/upload/v1744045780/Portfolio/FrontendSystemDesignCourse/4_iildzs.png","auther_name":"Rahul Aher","is_on_youtube":false,"_path":"frontend-system-design-1-4"},{"id":5,"topic_name":"A quick overview of gRPC","sub_topic":"Networking","publish_date":"2025-03-05","description":"It's kind of like a sibling to REST API or GraphQL, enabling communication with the server in a unique way.
