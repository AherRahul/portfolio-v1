How does Node.js achieve this? In JavaScript, we follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), which is related to functions and scope. If you're unfamiliar, you can Google it. The idea is to only expose what is necessary to the global scope, keeping everything else private. To achieve PoLP, wrap your code in a function or immediately invoke it (IIFE).\n","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"duration":"8.00 mins read","photo_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/duojkrgue/image/upload/v1757930703/Portfolio/nodeJsCourse/5.png","auther_name":"Rahul Aher","is_on_youtube":false,"_path":"beginner-to-advance-nodejs-1-5"},{"id":6,"topic_name":"libuv & async IO in Node.js","sub_topic":"NodeJS Basics - Module 1","publish_date":"2025-04-10","description":"If you read Node.js's definition, it mentions an event-driven architecture and its ability to handle asynchronous I/O.
