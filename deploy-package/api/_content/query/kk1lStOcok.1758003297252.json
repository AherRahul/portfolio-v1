It is a structured approach to designing complex systems that meet specific requirements and perform efficiently under varying conditions. The primary goal of systems design is to translate user needs, business goals, and technical constraints into a well-organized and effective system structure. Systems design bridges the gap between these requirements and the actual implementation, ensuring the system is both usable and efficient.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/what-is-system-design.md","dateModified":"2024-05-22","datePublished":"2024-05-22","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"beginner-system-design","topics":["system-design","aws","lld"],"readingTime":{"text":"6 min read","minutes":5.315,"time":318900,"words":1063},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:what-is-system-design.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/what-is-system-design.md","_stem":"articles/what-is-system-design","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/articles/what-is-system-design"}},{"_path":"/courses/02-frontend-system-design","_dir":"courses","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Frontend System Design","description":"This course is designed to take you from Zero to Hero in Frontend System Design.

All of this happens through the network. How is data transferred over the internet? How does it reach the client, and what protocols are required?
