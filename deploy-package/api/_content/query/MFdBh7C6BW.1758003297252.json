Node.js is a fast, scalable runtime that enables asynchronous, event-driven programming, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps and streaming services. You'll also learn to build server-side applications from scratch, manage dependencies with npm, and use frameworks like Express.js.","slidesUrl":"https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles","dateModified":"2025-04-06","datePublished":"2025-04-06","showOnArticles":false,"courseName":"01-beginner-to-advance-nodejs","topics":["nodejs","javascript"],"readingTime":{"text":"5 min read","minutes":4.165,"time":249900,"words":833},"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"image.png","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/duojkrgue/image/upload/v1757930701/Portfolio/nodeJsCourse/2_zzsbpy.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As we know now JS can also run outside of browsers on server."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"what-is-server"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is server ?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"JavaScript runs on a server, but what exactly is a server?
