It is particularly useful in distributed hash tables (DHTs), distributed caching systems, and other distributed storage systems. Consistent hashing is a technique used in computer systems to distribute keys (e.g., cache keys) uniformly across a cluster of nodes (e.g., cache servers). The goal is to minimize the number of keys that need to be moved when nodes are added or removed from the cluster, thus reducing the impact of these changes on the overall system.","https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/consistent-hashing-algorithm.md","2024-05-23",[29772,29997,29998],{"text":30890,"minutes":30891,"time":30892,"words":30893},"17 min read",16.655,999300,3331,{"type":23,"children":30895,"toc":32198},[30896,30900,30905,30923,30928,30938,30943,30949,30954,30982,30988,30993,31026,31032,31038,31061,31067,31090,31096,31101,31107,31111,31116,31121,31127,31131,31136,31149,31155,31160,31188,31193,31197,31202,31207,31211,31216,31221,31225,31230,31235,31239,31244,31265,31270,31276,31280,31285,31291,31295,31300,31318,31324,31328,31333,31338,31342,31347,31353,31357,31362,31368,31372,31377,31383,31387,31392,31410,31416,31420,31425,31431,31435,31440,31446,31450,31455,31460,31483,31489,31493,31498,31504,31508,31513,31531,31536,31542,31546,31551,31555,31570,31585,31591,31597,31601,31613,31626,31632,31636,31641,31659,31665,31669,31674,31692,31698,31702,31707,31725,31731,31736,31838,31843,31849,31861,31867,31906,31912,31917,31935,31940,31958,31964,31969,31987,31992,32020,32026,32032,32036,32041,32047,32051,32056,32062,32066,32071,32077,32081,32086,32092,32097,32103,32108,32121,32129,32133,32138,32143,32151,32155,32160,32165,32170,32176,32181,32184,32188],{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":30897,"children":30898},{},[30899],{"type":40,"value":30885},{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":30901,"children":30902},{},[30903],{"type":40,"value":30904},"The target audience for this article falls into the following roles:",{"type":26,"tag":74,"props":30906,"children":30907},{},[30908,30913,30918],{"type":26,"tag":47,"props":30909,"children":30910},{},[30911],{"type":40,"value":30912},"Tech workers",{"type":26,"tag":47,"props":30914,"children":30915},{},[30916],{"type":40,"value":30917},"Students",{"type":26,"tag":47,"props":30919,"children":30920},{},[30921],{"type":40,"value":30922},"Engineering managers",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":30924,"children":30925},{},[30926],{"type":40,"value":30927},"The prerequisite to reading this article is fundamental knowledge of system design components.

The term “ACID” stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the four key properties of an ACID transaction. Essentially, ACID transactions guarantee that database operations are executed correctly, and if there is any kind of failure, the database can recover to a previous state without losing any data or impacting the consistency of the data. In other words, ACID transactions provide a high level of assurance that database transactions will be processed reliably and that data will be stored accurately and consistently.","https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/acid-transactions.md","2024-05-22",[29772,29997,29998],{"text":32298,"minutes":32299,"time":32300,"words":32301},"10 min read",9.7,582000,1940,{"type":23,"children":32303,"toc":32811},[32304,32310,32314,32320,32325,32331,32336,32342,32347,32353,32358,32364,32369,32375,32380,32398,32404,32409,32432,32437,32443,32448,32454,32459,32467,32473,32478,32484,32489,32495,32500,32610,32616,32621,32627,32632,32638,32643,32649,32654,32660,32665,32671,32676,32681,32691,32700,32710,32719,32725,32730,32773,32778,32783,32786,32790],{"type":26,"tag":9568,"props":32305,"children":32307},{"id":32306},"acid-transactions-defined",[32308],{"type":40,"value":32309},"Acid Transactions Defined",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":32311,"children":32312},{},[32313],{"type":40,"value":32293},{"type":26,"tag":9568,"props":32315,"children":32317},{"id":32316},"understanding-acid-transactions",[32318],{"type":40,"value":32319},"Understanding acid transactions",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":32321,"children":32322},{},[32323],{"type":40,"value":32324},"An ACID transaction is a set of properties that ensure the reliability and consistency of a database transaction.

Design is a critical discipline in software engineering, focused on creating a detailed blueprint for a system’s architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data. It is a structured approach to designing complex systems that meet specific requirements and perform efficiently under varying conditions. The primary goal of systems design is to translate user needs, business goals, and technical constraints into a well-organized and effective system structure. Systems design bridges the gap between these requirements and the actual implementation, ensuring the system is both usable and

During times of normal operations, a data store covers all three. However, according to the CAP theorem, a distributed database system can provide either consistency or availability when it experiences a network failure. In other words, in case of a network failure, it’s a tradeoff between consistency or availability, and that choice must be made in advance.","https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/cap-theorem.md","2024-05-21",[29772,29997,29998],{"text":20341,"minutes":43898,"time":43899,"words":43900},12.155,729300,2431,{"type":23,"children":43902,"toc":44624},[43903,43907,43912,43916,43922,43927,43958,43963,43968,43973,43978,43991,43996,44002,44007,44012,44034,44040,44045,44057,44065,44070,44076,44081,44104,44113,44150,44156,44161,44166,44175,44188,44197,44214,44220,44225,44230,44239,44257,44262,44268,44274,44279,44287,44292,44328,44334,44339,44344,44349,44367,44373,44378,44442,44447,44457,44463,44468,44473,44491,44496,44506,44512,44524,44529,44547,44557,44563,44568,44573,44579,44584,44589,44595,44600,44603,44607],{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":43904,"children":43905},{},[43906],{"type":40,"value":43893},{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":43908,"children":43909},{},[43910],{"type":40,"value":43911},"Let’s take a look.",{"type":26,"tag":31,"props":43913,"children":43915},{"src":43914,"alt":8,"width":29793,"height":29794},"https://s7280.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/key-65.png",[],{"type":26,"tag":9568,"props":43917,"children":43919},{"id":43918},"what-is-the-cap-theorem",[43920],{"type":40,"value":43921},"What is the CAP theorem?",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":43923,"children":43924},{},[43925],{"type":40,"value":43926},"The CAP Theorem is comprised of three components (hence its name) as they relate to distributed data stores:",{"type":26,"tag":74,"props":43928,"children":43929},{},[43930,43939,43948],{"type":26,"tag":47,"props":43931,"children":43932},{},[43933,43937],{"type":26,"tag":51,"props":43934,"children":43935},{},[43936],{"type":40,"value":32341},{"type":40,"value":43938},": All reads receive the most recent write or an error.",{"type":26,"tag":47,"props":43940,"children":43941},{},[43942,43946],{"type":26,"tag":51,"props":43943,"children":43944},{},[43945],{"type":40,"value":32707},{"type":40,"value":43947},": All reads contain data, but it might not be the most recent.",{"type":26,"tag":47,"props":43949,"children":43950},{},[43951,43956],{"type":26,"tag":51,"props":43952,"children":43953},{},[43954],{"type":40,"value":43955},"Partition tolerance",{"type":40,"value":43957},": The system continues to operate despite network failures (ie; dropped partitions, slow network connections, or unavailable network connections between nodes.)",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":43959,"children":43960},{},[43961],{"type":40,"value":43962},"In normal operations, your data store provides all three functions.
