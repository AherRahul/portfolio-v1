It begins with the basics of web browsers sending HTTP/HTTPS requests to servers and receiving responses. The role of DNS (Domain Name System) in translating domain names into IP addresses, which act as unique identifiers for devices on a network, is crucial.The topic delves into protocols like TCP/IP, which ensure reliable data transmission across networks, and explores concepts such as request-response cycles and status codes that define server interactions.
