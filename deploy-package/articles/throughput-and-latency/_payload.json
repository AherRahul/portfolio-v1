Latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network. Networks with a longer delay or lag have high latency, while those with fast response times have lower latency. In contrast, throughput refers to the average volume of data that can actually pass through the network over a specific time. It indicates the number of data packets that arrive at their destinations successfully and the data packet loss.","https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/throughput-and-latency.md","2024-05-20",true,[14,15,16],"system-design","aws","lld",{"text":18,"minutes":19,"time":20,"words":21},"8 min read",7.01,420600,1402,{"type":23,"children":24,"toc":578},"root",[25,32,42,49,54,59,64,69,75,80,90,95,100,105,114,121,126,131,137,142,151,156,165,177,184,192,197,200,208,213,217,225,230,239,244,252,257,261,269,274,279,283,291,296,300,308,313,318,322,328,333,338,343,349,354,359,365,370,375,381,386,391,397,402,407,412,418,423,428,434,438,555,559,564],{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":28,"children":29},"element","p",{},[30],{"type":31,"value":9},"text",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":33,"children":34},{},[35],{"type":26,"tag":36,"props":37,"children":39},"a",{"href":38},"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/latency/",[40],{"type":31,"value":41},"Read about latency »",{"type":26,"tag":43,"props":44,"children":46},"h2",{"id":45},"why-are-throughput-and-latency-important",[47],{"type":31,"value":48},"Why are throughput and latency important?",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":50,"children":51},{},[52],{"type":31,"value":53},"You can determine network speed by looking at how quickly a network can transfer data packets to their destinations.
