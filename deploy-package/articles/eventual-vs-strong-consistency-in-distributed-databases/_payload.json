Strong consistency may require additional coordination mechanisms that slow down operations. Therefore, choosing the appropriate consistency model involves striking a balance between data correctness and system performance, based on the specific requirements of the application and use case. Different systems may opt for eventual consistency or other weaker consistency models if absolute real-time consistency is not necessary for their functionality.","https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/eventual-vs-strong-consistency-in-distributed-databases.md","2024-05-25",true,[14,15,16],"system-design","aws","lld",{"text":18,"minutes":19,"time":20,"words":21},"4 min read",3.785,227100,757,{"type":23,"children":24,"toc":274},"root",[25,32,37,50,55,62,67,72,77,86,91,98,103,111,116,121,125,130,176,181,189,194,200,205,210,218,222,227,252,257,263,269],{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":28,"children":29},"element","p",{},[30],{"type":31,"value":9},"text",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":33,"children":34},{},[35],{"type":31,"value":36},"Explanation of this topic starts with an analogy, taking an example from real life to understand the concept better.",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":38,"children":39},{},[40,42,48],{"type":31,"value":41},"I have the habit of writing something I call ",{"type":26,"tag":43,"props":44,"children":45},"em",{},[46],{"type":31,"value":47},"Tech Notes",{"type":31,"value":49}," on my laptop daily to summarize technical concepts that I learn.
