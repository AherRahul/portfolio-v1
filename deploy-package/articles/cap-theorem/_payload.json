During times of normal operations, a data store covers all three. However, according to the CAP theorem, a distributed database system can provide either consistency or availability when it experiences a network failure. In other words, in case of a network failure, it’s a tradeoff between consistency or availability, and that choice must be made in advance.","https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/cap-theorem.md","2024-05-21",true,[14,15,16],"system-design","aws","lld",{"text":18,"minutes":19,"time":20,"words":21},"13 min read",12.155,729300,2431,{"type":23,"children":24,"toc":773},"root",[25,32,37,44,51,56,92,97,102,107,112,125,130,136,141,146,168,174,179,191,200,205,211,216,239,249,287,293,298,303,312,325,334,351,357,362,367,376,394,399,405,412,417,427,432,469,475,480,485,490,509,515,520,584,589,599,605,610,615,633,638,648,654,666,671,689,699,705,710,715,721,726,731,737,742,746,751],{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":28,"children":29},"element","p",{},[30],{"type":31,"value":9},"text",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":33,"children":34},{},[35],{"type":31,"value":36},"Let’s take a look.",{"type":26,"tag":38,"props":39,"children":43},"img",{"src":40,"alt":7,"width":41,"height":42},"https://s7280.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/key-65.png",700,350,[],{"type":26,"tag":45,"props":46,"children":48},"h2",{"id":47},"what-is-the-cap-theorem",[49],{"type":31,"value":50},"What is the CAP theorem?",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":52,"children":53},{},[54],{"type":31,"value":55},"The CAP Theorem is comprised of three components (hence its name) as they relate to distributed data stores:",{"type":26,"tag":57,"props":58,"children":59},"ul",{},[60,72,82],{"type":26,"tag":61,"props":62,"children":63},"li",{},[64,70],{"type":26,"tag":65,"props":66,"children":67},"strong",{},[68],{"type":31,"value":69},"Consistency",{"type":31,"value":71},": All reads receive the most recent write or an error.",{"type":26,"tag":61,"props":73,"children":74},{},[75,80],{"type":26,"tag":65,"props":76,"children":77},{},[78],{"type":31,"value":79},"Availability",{"type":31,"value":81},": All reads contain data, but it might not be the most recent.",{"type":26,"tag":61,"props":83,"children":84},{},[85,90],{"type":26,"tag":65,"props":86,"children":87},{},[88],{"type":31,"value":89},"Partition tolerance",{"type":31,"value":91},": The system continues to operate despite network failures (ie; dropped partitions, slow network connections, or unavailable network connections between nodes.)",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":93,"children":94},{},[95],{"type":31,"value":96},"In normal operations, your data store provides all three functions.

The greatest benefit of this is that, he can work in background and one of your or your wife’s “update” doesn’t have to block, waiting for the other one to update. This is how many NoSql systems work, one node updates itself locally and a background process synchronizes all other nodes accordingly… The only problem is that you will lose consistency of some time. For eg., a customer’s call reaches your wife first and before the clerk has a chance to update your notebook , the customer’ calls back and it reaches you. Then he won’t get a consistent reply..
