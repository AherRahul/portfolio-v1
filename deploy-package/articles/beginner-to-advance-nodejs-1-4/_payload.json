According to the JavaScript foundation, the future will favor ES Modules (ESM), but currently, most of the industry still uses CJS. CJS is synchronous, meaning it requires all files before running the next line of code, whereas ES6 Modules can be asynchronous, offering better performance. CJS runs in a non-strict mode, while ESM runs in strict mode. ES6/ESM is the default in React and new libraries.
