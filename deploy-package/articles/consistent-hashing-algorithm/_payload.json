It is particularly useful in distributed hash tables (DHTs), distributed caching systems, and other distributed storage systems. Consistent hashing is a technique used in computer systems to distribute keys (e.g., cache keys) uniformly across a cluster of nodes (e.g., cache servers). The goal is to minimize the number of keys that need to be moved when nodes are added or removed from the cluster, thus reducing the impact of these changes on the overall system.","https://github.com/AherRahul/portfolio-v1/blob/main/content/articles/consistent-hashing-algorithm.md","2024-05-23",true,[14,15,16],"system-design","aws","lld",{"text":18,"minutes":19,"time":20,"words":21},"17 min read",16.655,999300,3331,{"type":23,"children":24,"toc":1348},"root",[25,32,37,57,62,73,78,85,90,119,125,130,163,169,176,199,205,228,234,239,245,252,257,262,268,272,277,290,296,301,329,334,338,343,348,352,357,362,366,371,376,380,385,408,413,419,423,428,434,438,443,461,467,471,476,481,485,490,496,500,505,511,515,520,526,530,535,553,559,563,568,574,578,583,589,593,598,603,626,632,636,641,647,651,656,674,679,685,689,694,698,714,729,735,741,745,757,770,776,780,785,803,809,813,818,836,842,846,851,869,875,880,982,987,993,1005,1011,1051,1057,1062,1080,1085,1103,1109,1114,1132,1137,1165,1171,1177,1181,1186,1192,1196,1201,1207,1211,1216,1222,1226,1231,1237,1242,1248,1253,1266,1274,1278,1283,1288,1296,1300,1305,1310,1315,1321,1326,1330,1335],{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":28,"children":29},"element","p",{},[30],{"type":31,"value":9},"text",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":33,"children":34},{},[35],{"type":31,"value":36},"The target audience for this article falls into the following roles:",{"type":26,"tag":38,"props":39,"children":40},"ul",{},[41,47,52],{"type":26,"tag":42,"props":43,"children":44},"li",{},[45],{"type":31,"value":46},"Tech workers",{"type":26,"tag":42,"props":48,"children":49},{},[50],{"type":31,"value":51},"Students",{"type":26,"tag":42,"props":53,"children":54},{},[55],{"type":31,"value":56},"Engineering managers",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":58,"children":59},{},[60],{"type":31,"value":61},"The prerequisite to reading this article is fundamental knowledge of system design components.
